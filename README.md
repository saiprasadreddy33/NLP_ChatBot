# NLP_ChatBot
A start implementation of simple Chat-Bot using python3 and NLTK library.

NLP Chatbot

This project is an NLP-based chatbot that can be trained to recognize different types of user input and respond appropriately. It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify user input into categories such as greeting, farewell, and question. The chatbot then responds to the input with an appropriate message based on the category.

*Dependencies*

The following dependencies are required to run this code:

    Python 3.x
    NLTK library
    collections module
    functools module
    threading module
    cProfile module

*Installation*

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

pip install nltk

*Usage*

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.

    Open a terminal window and navigate to the repository folder.

    Run the chatbot.py file using the following command:

    python NLP_chatbot.py

    The chatbot will ask you to enter your input. Type in your message and press enter.

    The chatbot will classify your input into one of the categories and respond with an appropriate message.

*Training the model*

To train the model on your own data, follow these steps:

    Create a new text file called training_data.txt.
    
 *FUTURE DEVELOPMENT*
    
It can be extended and can be done like a GUI interface with proper app setting and with instants.
